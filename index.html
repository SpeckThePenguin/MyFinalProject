			<h2>Mercury</h2>
			<p>Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun, and it is the smallest planet in the Solar System. It has a rocky surface and no atmosphere, which means that it experiences extreme temperature variations. It takes just 88 Earth days for Mercury to orbit the Sun.</p>

			<h2>Venus</h2>
			<p>Venus is the second planet from the Sun, and it is similar in size and composition to Earth. However, its thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide and sulfuric acid makes it one of the hottest planets in the Solar System, with temperatures that can melt lead. Venus takes 225 Earth days to orbit the Sun.</p>

			<h2>Earth</h2>
			<p>Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and it is the only planet known to support life. It has a rocky surface, oceans of liquid water, and a protective atmosphere that shields us from the harsh radiation of space. Earth takes 365.24 days to orbit the Sun.</p>

			<h2>Mars</h2>
			<p>Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun, and it is often referred to as the Red Planet because of its rusty appearance. It has a thin atmosphere, polar ice caps, and evidence of liquid water on its surface in the past. Mars takes 687 Earth days to orbit the Sun.</p>

			<h2>Jupiter</h2>
			<p>Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun, and it is the largest planet in the Solar System. It is a gas giant with no solid surface, and it has a massive magnetic field that generates intense radiation belts. Jupiter takes 11.86 Earth years to orbit the Sun.</p>

			<h2>Saturn</h2>
			<p>Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun, and it is best known for its beautiful rings made of ice particles and dust. It is also a gas giant with no solid surface, and it has a magnetic field that is weaker than Jupiter's. Saturn takes 29.46 Earth years to orbit the Sun.</p>

			<h2>Uranus</h2>
			<p>Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun, and it is an ice giant with a thin ring system. It has a tilted axis of rotation, which means that its poles are located where other planets have their equators. Uranus takes 84.02 Earth years to orbit the Sun.</p>

			<h2>Neptune</h2>
			<p>Neptune is an ice giant. Most of its mass is a hot, dense fluid of "icy" materials â€“ water, methane and ammonia - above a small rocky core. Neptune's atmosphere is made up mostly of molecular hydrogen, atomic helium and methane.</p>
